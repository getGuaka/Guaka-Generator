This folder is autogenerated. Dont edit it.
To generate this folder again run

```
make clone-swiftline
```

## Why this hack?
I needed to use a different branch of `Swiftline` and since Swift Package Manager does not allow to specify the branch to use. A similar hack is needed.

This hack will be removed when `oarrabi/linux!` branch is merge into swiftline
